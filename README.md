# Approach to solve this assignment
- first i thought about making models(user, books, exchange)
- then i thought about the fields in models and relationship in models. either it is one to one or one to many
- after making db models and specifying to relationship between models i started code
- i first setup the backend and add all api routes that is needed and then code in the end
- i face few issues but solving this assignment was fun
